![](Images/logo.jpg)

# Prereqs
- Reading and understanding of Zybooks Chapter 2.9, and 3.13 - 3.15

# Directions :

1) Clone this repo
2) We will start the assignment together in class
3) You have been provided an AJAX library for talking to an API using callback functions(AJAXLibrary.js, appAjax.js, indexAjax.html)
4) Load the indexAJAX.html and check the console for the responses. Uncomment out the method calls in appAjax.js to performed the various API calls.
5) Using the AJAXLibrary.js and appAjax.js as a reference complete the fetchLibrary.js and appFetch.js, remember that fetch uses promises.
6) The get request has been completed for you in fetchLibrary.js and called from the appFetch.js
7) Complete post, put, and delete in the fetchLibrary and appFetch.js
8) Use the fetch example that we made in class today as a reference.
9) Commit early and often
10) We will go over one possible solution in class

## Notes

We will build the AJAXLibrary as a group in class and we will start the FetchLibrary.js, you must complete it.

Commit early and often. Come to office hours or reach out on canvas for assistance
